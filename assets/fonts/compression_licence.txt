## Licence

This font is part of the ZX Origins font collection Copyright (c) 1988-2023 Damien Guard.

Formal licenses are complicated and burdensome so here's the deal. These are some acceptable use examples:

1. Use it in your game (commercial or non-commercial)
2. Print something on a t-shirt
3. Use the embedded font file on your site
4. Set your favorite terminal or OS to use it

Ideally with a credit like "<fontname> font by DamienG https://damieng.com/zx-origins" _if_ you have a credits section. If you don't that's fine. Either way dropping me an email at damieng@gmail.com to let me know what you used it for **is appreciated**.

The only prohibited use is redistributing this font as a font. i.e. re-hosting the files on your own site or bundling it with other art assets or using it to create assets. I have put a lot of time into these and my only reward is seeing download counts on my site which is ad-free so it seems unfair other people would re-host these files on their site and make $ from Google AdWords etc.

If you need to modify the font for your usage - either to add characters (this collection is pure ASCII + copyright + UK pound sign right now) or if a few are bothering you just change the credit to "Font based on <fontname> by DamienG" or something.

Thanks and enjoy!
